# AdoraPlan - Eucharistic Adoration Planner

**AdoraPlan** is a Eucharistic Adoration Scheduler App designed to modernize and simplify the coordination of adoration time slots within the **St. Pius X Parish** community, with the potential for expansion to the **Archdiocese of Seattle**.

## Objectives

- Replace manual sign-up sheets with a streamlined digital solution.
- Enable parishioners to reserve, manage, trade, or drop adoration time slots.
- Provide a communication channel (Q&A Chat) between parishioners.
- Ensure secure access using barcode scans and encrypted user data.
- Promote spiritual engagement by enhancing accessibility and reliability.
- Support administrators with reporting features and schedule oversight.
