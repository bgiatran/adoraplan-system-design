# README: AdoraPlan - Eucharistic Adoration Planner

## Project Overview

**AdoraPlan** is a Eucharistic Adoration Scheduler App designed to modernize and simplify the coordination of adoration time slots within the **St. Pius X Parish** community, with the potential for expansion to the **Archdiocese of Seattle**. It addresses the challenge of managing continuous presence during Eucharistic veneration by offering a secure, mobile-accessible scheduling platform.

## Objectives

- Replace manual sign-up sheets with a streamlined digital solution.
- Enable parishioners to reserve, manage, trade, or drop adoration time slots.
- Provide a communication channel (Q&A Chat) between parishioners.
- Ensure secure access using barcode scans and encrypted user data.
- Promote spiritual engagement by enhancing accessibility and reliability.
- Support administrators with reporting features and schedule oversight.

## What I Learned

Throughout the course of this project, I developed key skills and insights in system design and implementation:

- 📋 **Requirement Gathering**  
  Learned how to engage stakeholders and translate their needs into functional system components.

- 📐 **System Modeling**  
  Built use case diagrams, class diagrams, and metadata models using UML tools like LucidChart.

- 💡 **Technical Planning**  
  Understood the full lifecycle of a project: from vision and feasibility to architecture and interface design.

- 🔐 **Security and Compliance**  
  Gained awareness of data protection standards such as **GDPR** and **FLSA**, and how to build compliant systems.

- 📱 **UX/UI Design**  
  Designed interfaces with accessibility and simplicity in mind for a diverse user base, including older parishioners.

- 🧪 **Testing and Maintenance Planning**  
  Developed a testing roadmap and maintenance strategy for post-launch stability and improvements.

## Next Steps

- Conduct usability testing with a group of parishioners.
- Finalize development and debug the full system.
- Launch the application officially for St. Pius X and train church staff.
- Maintain system performance and prepare for feature updates.
